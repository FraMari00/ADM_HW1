# ADM_HW1
In the **Section_1** Folder there are 2 files: 
1. A markdown jupyter file with all the codes of section1 problems;
2. A unique pdf with all the submissions that I've done in Hackerank.
   
The **Section_2** Folder follows the same pattern, but with problem solving problems.

The **Grades_AWS** pdf contains the grades of all the modules we had to complete.
